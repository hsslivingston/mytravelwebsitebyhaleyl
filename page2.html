    <h3 class="flight">Booking a flight to Hydra</h3>
    <p3> Finding cheap and affordable flights is one of the most challenging aspects for travelers. The price of flying seems to be going up every year. To assist with budgeting for your flight to Hydra, here are some tips for when it's time to find your flight:</p3>
    <ul>
    <li> Go to Hydra during the months where the tourists ratio is low. If you want to travel to Hydra in the summer, we suggest going in early May, or late August to avoid the crowds</li>
        <img src="maycal.jpeg" alt="may calendar" width="500px">
        <br>
    <li>Take a redeye! We know getting up at the crack of dawn or staying up very late is hard for some travlers. One benefit of taking a redeye is that it prepares travlers for jetlag. The prices also are lowered for red-eye flights because the population of flyers is less dense during these hours</li>

        <br>
        <li>Don't fly first class, the regular cabin is just fine. Most flights overseas have comfortable seating in the main cabin and have snack and beverage at your exposure. They also offer WIFI for a small fee if you are interested. Don't break the bank on your flight!</li>

    </ul>
    <p4>Keep in mind budgeting for the ferry.<strong>There are no direct flights from The United States to Hydra!</strong> You have to fly to Athens, Greece. From Athens, you can take a ferry to Hydra, costing between 38 to 50 Euros for a one-way ferry trip. </p4>
